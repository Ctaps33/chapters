Sadly, in Latin, word order doesn't matter. In English, if you write

Latin nouns are divided into six classes called declensions. A declension is a set of noun endings that determine case and number.

There are 6 cases in every declension. Each case is used for a different part of speech:
 1. Nominative - nouns.
 2. Genitive - possessives.
 3. Dative - indirect objects.
 4. Accusative - direct objects.
 5. Ablative - object of prepositions. It also has many other uses.
 6. Vocative - when the noun is being directly addressed.


For now, we'll only use the first five.

First Declension nouns usually have a **feminine** gender, but some nouns do have a masculine gender. The masculine gender nouns usually refer to occupations which would typically only have been done by Roman men (unfortunately).

(FYI, Roman men treated women very badly. They abused them to no end and called them "property". This cruelty also lead to the fall of the Roman Empire and the rise of the Roman Democracy. )

The singular endings for the First Declension are:
 1. -a (nom.)
 2. -ae (gen.)
 3. -ae (dat.)
 4. -am (acc.)
 5. -ā (abl.)
 The plural endings for the First Declension are:
 
 1. -ae (nom.)
 2. -ārum (gen.)
 3. -is (dat.)
 4. -as (acc.)
 5. -is (abl.)
 
##Rules

Each Latin noun has a stem. You find the stem by cutting the ending off of the genitive singular. When you look up a noun, you will have the nominative and genitive singular. It will be up to you to use the genitive singular to find the stem.


Example: Poeta, poetae (m) – poet. The stem is poet. I found that out by cutting the -ae off of poetae.
All endings are added onto that stem.
Every Latin noun has a gender. 

There are 3 important exceptions: agricola, poeta, and nauta, which are all masculine.
Proper names are nouns, and will decline just like any other word.


Case uses: While we will learn many different cases uses throughout the year, here are a few simple ones.

Nominative, subject, does the action. The **poet** loves the woman.

Genitive, possession, possesses the noun it’s next to. **The poet’s** wife is pretty. To translate a possessive into English, either add ‘s in the singular (farmer’s), s’ in the plural (farmers’), or the preposition “of” (of the farmer).

Accusative, direct object, action is done to it. The farmer loves **the woman**.

Ablative, prepositional phrase, certain words like in, from, with, because, and so on are called prepositions and require a noun to complete their meaning. In Latin, that noun will often be ablative. I am in the farmhouse. In is a preposition, thus the word “farmhouse” would have to be ablative in Latin.

##Translation rules

The words “a,” “an,” and “the” (articles) do not exist in Latin. You can always add them. However, since word order matters in English, but not Latin, you will often need to change the word order around to correctly translate a Latin sentence into English.

That's it for now! Please leave comments if you have any questions/suggestions!
